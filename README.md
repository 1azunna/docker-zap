# docker-zap

For now, this is here to help me collect, organize, and articulate my [goals](https://wiki.mozilla.org/QA/Execution/Web_Testing/Goals/2016/Q2#Stephen) and progress on an attempt to integrate a Dockerized OWASP-ZAP command-line client, into Jenkins.

I'm using the following, currently:

* https://github.com/Grunny/zap-cli

Feedback and pull requests are most welcome :-)
