# docker-zap

For now, this is here to help me collect, organize, and articulate my [goal](https://wiki.mozilla.org/QA/Execution/Web_Testing/Goals/2016/Q2#Stephen) and progress on an attempt to integrate a Dockerized [OWASP-ZAP] (https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Zed_Attack_Proxy_Project) command-line client, into [Jenkins] (https://webqa-ci.mozilla.com/).

I've blogged about the above, here: https://blog.mozilla.org/webqa/2016/06/28/dockerized-owasp-zap-security-scanning-in-jenkins-part-two/

There's also an implicit goal of not unnecessarily duplicating others' work, where possible.

I'm using the following, currently:
* https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/wiki/Docker
* https://github.com/Grunny/zap-cli

Feedback and pull requests are most welcome :-)
